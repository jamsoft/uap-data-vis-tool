# UAP Data Visualisation Tool

## Getting started

Download the tool here:
https://github.com/jamsoft/uap-data-vis-tool/raw/main/downloads/JamSoft.UapTool.exe

## Loading Data

The tool isn't supplied with the JSON data file but will automatically download the latest version for you.

1. Launch the executable by double-clicking the .exe file you just downloaded
2. Click the Load Hatch Data button
3. The tool loads the hatch data file (hatch_udb.json) found next to the exe on disk, or it will download it for you.
4. Explore the data

The data has been painstakingly formatted, sourced and processed by Rich Geldreich as part of his UFO Data project which you can find [here](https://github.com/richgel999/ufo_data). Thanks Rich!

Currently this tool only supports the Hatch JSON data file which can be found [here](https://github.com/richgel999/ufo_data/blob/main/bin/hatch_udb.json).

# Supported Platforms

Currently the tool only supports 64-bit Windows, we have MacOS and Linux versions incoming once I've had enough time to test these builds.
